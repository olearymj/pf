				<p class="project-description">
					Rufflr is a fashion and social media startup based in London that allows users to save items of clothing to an online profile from around the web. Users can interact with one another on the sit and link their Rufflr profiles to their other social media accounts. Rufflr is also a platform for fashion-related editorial content such as photoshoots, interviews and style collections.

					I worked initially as a junior front end developer and designer and eventually acted as the sole in house developer for Rufflr.
